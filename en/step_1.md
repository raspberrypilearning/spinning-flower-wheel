## What you will make
In this resource you will create a digital landscape with your Raspberry Pi by making an electronic garden of spinning flowers, pinwheels, and even some bees! Who said gardening was difficult? Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fs7y7gZIag) for some more inspiration.

## What you will learn
By creating a spinning flower with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to connect a motor to a Raspberry Pi
- How to make the motor spin with Python code
